        //      (yes, this is a bit of a mindf*ck)
        // - Let's use an example to makes things clear:
        //      - Peer sends packet 5 
        //      - We receive packet 5 and add it to "list of things to be ACKed" (see :onPacketReceived)

        //          - we don't keep another copy of our sent packets here, only in loss detection
        //          - here, we only have a list of "things we have received that have yet to be ACKed"
        //      - Peer sends ACK in their packet nr. 6 to us for our packet 20 
        //      - We receive packet 6 and unwrap the ACK frame to find that our packet 20 was acked (see LossDetection:onSentPacketAcked)
        //          - packet 20 is now also removed from our local sent packet list because it was acked (should not be retransmitted, so we have no reason to keep copy)
        //      - We now need to remove packet 5 from our "list of things to be ACKed": that's exactly what this here method does!
        //          - sentPacket is our own packet 20
        //          - We look up which packets our packet 20 was ACKing (see "determineAckedPacketNumbers") and find it's nr. 5 
        //          - this.receivedPackets is the "list of things to be ACKed" and still contains this nr. 5
        //          - since our ACK for received packet 5 was successfully received by the peer (as they have ACKed our packet nr. 20 in turn), we can safely remove it

        // TODO: here, we keep ACKing older packets indefinitely
        // in the spec, it says that upon reception of ACK-of-an-ACK (packet nr. 6 above), we can stop sending everything below the highest ACKed number
